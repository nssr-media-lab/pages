  <h1>Our Values</h1>

  <div id="disruption" class ="collapse">
    <p>We believe in the value of taking risks. Facebook has always and will continue to welcome bold problem-solvers with ideas that push boundaries and break conventions. As we like to say at Facebook: “The riskiest thing is to take no risks.” If we can, we should.</p>
  </div>
  
  <button type="button" class="btn btn-link" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="safety">Safety</button>
  <div id="safety" class ="collapse">
    <p>The security of your personal information and your safety offline are our highest priorities. We are constantly working to stay one step ahead of the world’s most advanced cybersecurity threats. We design and build products with an eye to safety, always exercising the utmost caution.</p>
  </div>
  
  <button type="button" class="btn btn-link" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="personalization">Personalization</button>
  <div id="personalization" class="collapse">
    <p>We understand that some of what gets shared on Facebook can be offensive or upsetting to portions of our global community. So we think all users should be able to see only what is suitable or interesting to them. (More TK)<p>
  </div>
  
  <button type="button" class="btn btn-link" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="connection">Connection</button>
  <div id="connection" class="collapse">
    <p>What we're doing at Facebook is bringing the world closer together. We provide the platform on which people can come in contact with views different from their own and come to understand one another through reasoned debate and discussion.<p>

  Our Values
  </h1>
  
<button class="accordion">Disruption</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>We believe in the value of taking risks. Facebook has always and will continue to welcome bold problem-solvers with ideas that push boundaries and break conventions. As we like to say at Facebook: “The riskiest thing is to take no risks.” If we can, we should.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Safety</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>The security of your personal information and your safety offline is our utmost priority. We are constantly working to stay one step ahead of the world’s most advanced cybersecurity threats. We design and build products with an eye to safety, always exercising the utmost caution.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Personalization</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>We understand that some of what gets shared on Facebook can be offensive or upsetting to portions of our global community. So we think all users should be able to see only what is suitable or interesting to them.</p>
